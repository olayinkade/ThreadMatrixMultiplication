Uses threads to do Matrix Multiplication. The matrices are hard coded in the thread.c file. This algorithm creates a thread for each position in the resultant matrix.

# Setup
1. Compile using command line use ``clang -o thread thread.c -lpthread`` (Or any other way to compile code)
2. To run using comand line use ``./thread``
